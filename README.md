# Garage system

This is a C# and .NET framework project that manages a garage.
The garage supports different types of vehicles such as motorcycle, electric car and even a truck.
You may find several functionalities at the garage such as the vehicle status, filling the gas/ charging the battery (for electric vehicle)
and display information about the vehicle.

This project was written during my object oriented programming in C# and the .NET framework course at college.
